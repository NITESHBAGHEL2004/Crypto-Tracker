# Crypto-Tracker

Real-Time Crypto Price Tracker is a front-end web application built using React and Redux Toolkit that simulates real-time tracking of cryptocurrency prices. Designed to mimic platforms like CoinMarketCap, the app dynamically updates prices, percentage changes, and volumes every few seconds using simulated WebSocket behavior.

The project demonstrates key front-end development concepts including:

State management with Redux Toolkit (createSlice, configureStore)

Responsive UI design with a clean, tabular layout

Simulated live data feeds using setInterval

Color-coded financial indicators for better user experience


The application is structured to allow easy integration with real-time APIs or WebSocket services in future upgrades.
